# Generators

The SQLEntitylookup class is used to load the student fields and student entities to be used in our Generator Program. The required Student field and entity objects are loaded into memory and will be used during the execution of our test program to test the query geenration.

The sqlenetity lookup can be added with required number of entities, fields and joins which will be used in our generation

The maven pom is being used to build the jar file. I had used the Maven log4j to enable loggin in the console.

To execute the test program , just run the Junit test program in the src/test folder with the required fields and joins and get the required inner join query needed.

A minimal testing has been done and need to evaluate further for better scenarios.
